      1. Profile
  </h4>


    <p>
      After authorizing through Steam, an account for the website is created and submitted into the database. Profiles are used to manage access to the rooms since a lot of
      sensitive information can be stored there.
      On your profile page you can see the rooms you are part of(1)
      Leaving a room you are an admin of will also delete the room. You can also create a new room(2). On the top right are navigation buttons(3).
      The panel on the top of the page is present on every page.<br />
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Fpho1.jpg?v=1561038406241" >
    </p>
    <hr><h4 id="roominterface">
      2. Room interface
    </h4>
    <p>
      The room interface consists of 4 main parts:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
              <li>The User list (1)</li>
              <li>The map (2)</li>
              <li>The management panel (3)</li>
              <li>The tabs (4)</li>
          </ul>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Fmpk.jpg?v=1561038580602">
  <h5 id="userlist">
    2.1 User list
  </h5>
    <p>
       The user list displays users that are part of this room. Black background means the user is offline, green blackground means the user is online. The frame around the user name indicates the role of the user:  </p>
         <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
              <li>Orange - admin</li>
              <li>Gold - moderator</li>
              <li>White - user</li>
          </ul>
  <p>
    Admins can manage all users, delete the room and transfer ownership. Moderators can manage all users except the admin and other moderators. Users have access to the room and change data in it.
  </p>
  <h5 id="maplabel">
    2.2 Map
  </h5>
  <p>
    The map consists of icons that represent various objects around the map. Every 3 seconds the server makes a request to the WarAPI, and, if there is new data, updates the map and sends the new data to all users. The icons on the map are divided by layers - you can turn on and off any layers if you want.
  </p>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Flab.jpg?v=1561038283527">
  <p>
    Hovering your mouse over an icon will display the tooltip. For most of the objects the tooltip displays notes and the time of last update. For refineries and factories the tooltip additionally displays the facility levels. This data cannot be automatically obtained from the game and is updated by users, thus the time of last update.
  </p>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Fr1.jpg?v=1561038282172">
  <p>
    Right clicking on the map will bring up a context menu that allows you to put various icons on the map.
  </p>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Fmcm.jpg?v=1561038283127">
  <h5 id="regionpan">
    2.3 Region pan menu
    </h5>
    <p>
      The region pan menu allows you to instantly pan to any region by clicking one of the buttons.
    </p>
      <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Fpanmap.jpg?v=1561116822959">
    <h5  id="filterpanel">
      2.4 Facility filters
    </h5>
    <p>
    Selecting a facility filter will hide all town icons except those that contain all of selected facilities. This means selecting both basic material and refined material filters will leave only towns on the map where both facilities are present. This filter also hides all fort and observation tower icons while active.
  </p>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Frefff.jpg?v=1561117117700">

  <h5 id="townpanel">
    3.1 Town panel
  </h5>
  <p>
    After clicking on a town, the town panel will appear and a selection marker will be shown at town's location. <b>The gray circle around the town hall or fort indicates the defense power radius.</b> <br /> The town panel consists of:
             <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
              <li>Refinery panel</li>
              <li>Production panel</li>
              <li>Stockpile panel</li>
              <li>Storage panel</li>
               <li>Notes panel</li>
               <li>Date of last update</li>

<p>
  Refinery and production panels contain information about the levels of facilities in the selected town. You can enter a number to edit the data or press the "Fill" button. Pressing the "Fill" button will mark the facility as complete and increase upgrade part requirement for further upgrades. <br> The stockpile and storage panels can contain information about items in stockpiles/storage depots. You can click on any item and enter a number to edit the data. The changes will be immediately sent to the server. The filter buttons allow users to filter buttons by categories. Pressing the "Empty" button will reduce the amount of all items to zero.
</p>

<p>
  The "Notes" section is present on all panels and can contain miscellaneous information about the selected item. Pressing "Save notes" will send the changes to the server. The "Last update" section contains information which says when was the last time this object has been updated.
</p>

<h5 id="fortpanel">
  3.2 Fort/Outpost panel
   </h5>
   <p>
     Fort panel is similar to the town panel, except it doesn't have the refinery/production facility panels. Outposts (FOBs) have an X button that allows you to delete them. You can change fort's faction and level in the menu.
   </p>
   <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Ffob.jpg?v=1561117967636">

  <h5 id="logipanel">
     3.3 Logi request panel
   </h5>
   <p>
    Logi requests can be placed anywhere on the map via a context menu. On the modal you can select the items for the request and set their priorities. You can select the amount of requested items via an input. Selecting 0 amount will mean the request is indefinite and will show up as "some".
   </p>
   <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Flogi9.jpg?v=1561039250463">
   <p>
     The panel itself says who is the creator of the request and has "Manufacturers" button(1) and "Edit request" button(2). Only the creator of the request can edit the request. Clicking on the "Manufacturers" button will show who is currently working on items for the request.
   </p>
   <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Flogi.jpg?v=1561117633588">

  <p>
    Clicking on the logi request items will transfer them to your production table. Everyone can see what items you are currently producing and coordinate their efforts. Clicking on items in production table will transfer them to the submit table. Alternatively, pressing "Open submit menu" button will transfer all items from production to submit table. Adding any items to the submit menu automatically collapses the logi request panel to give more space.
   </p>
   <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Fsubm.jpg?v=1561117762965">
   <p>
     Pressing "Submit items" will move the items from the submit table to the request table and mark it with green color. If the amount of a supplied item satisfies the request with the top priority, it will be crossed out. If it does not, the request will display the amount of item required and total amount requested on hover.
   </p>
   <h5 id="artypanel">
     3.4 Artillery
   </h5>
   <p>
     On the bottom right corner of the map is the artillery panel. Click on it to enable the artillery calculator. The artillery calculator allows you to calculate the required azimuth and distance based on the data from your binoculars. You can send the calculations to the rest of the room users by clicking the <b>Share result</b> button.
   </p>
      <img src="  https://cdn.glitch.com/dd3f06b2-b7d4-4ccc-8675-05897efc4bb5%2Farty2.jpg?v=1561132753160" />
   <p>
     You can click on any of the artillery icons on the bottom left panel to spawn an according icon at the center of your screen. <b>If you can't see the icon, don't worry! They only show up at medium and high zoom levels.</b> You can drag the icon around and see its range. You can click at any point withing the artillery's radius to see the range and azimuth for that point. With enough precision, a squad can use a set of howitzers using this map without binoculars. <b>Disclaimer: the development team does not guarantee firing accuracy based on the information from this map. Field artillery also has to take ballistic arc into account.</b>
   </p>
